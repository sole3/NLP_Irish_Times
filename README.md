## GOALS
We  propose an online topic modeling designed as a tool to organize, search, and understand vast quantities of textual information.

## Models
1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
2. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

##TOOLS
• Jupyter Notebook
• Numpy
• Pandas
• Matplotlib
• Seaborn
• HTML
• Sklearn
• Statsmodel.api
• Patsy
• Plotly

## CONCLUSION
The topic model can accomplish the task of clustering and classification of  data. Furthermore, each topic is interpreted as a probability distribution over words, a topic model can produce a more understandable result and thus may help a data scientist to interpret the finding.
